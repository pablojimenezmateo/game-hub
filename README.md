This is the complete source code for these courses: https://codewithmosh.com/p/ultimate-react-part1 and https://codewithmosh.com/p/ultimate-react-part2

The API consumed is [RAWG](https://rawg.io/)

I would encourage anyone that wants to learn React to do it, it really goes step by step and explains key concepts in a very easy to understand way.
